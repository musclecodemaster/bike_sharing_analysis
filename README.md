## General Information
This project involves building a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors such as temperature, weather, season, and working days. 

### Business Problem
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, experienced a revenue dip during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to help them predict bike demand after the pandemic and optimize operations to boost profitability【8†source】.

### Dataset
The dataset used includes daily data on bike rentals ('cnt') and features like weather conditions, holidays, and temperature levels.

## Conclusions
1. Temperature is a strong predictor of bike demand, positively correlated with rentals.
2. Weather conditions significantly impact demand, with adverse weather reducing rentals.
3. The year shows an increasing trend in popularity for bike rentals over time.
4. Linear regression assumptions were validated, ensuring the model's robustness.
